            <p>
                This website was started out on one idea, what
                if someone could go to a website to get all the
                best places and tips for camping and trailing.
                To explore Utah is one of the many great things
                to do here. There are not enough people who know
                or go on many trips with their family and friends.
                Once they do they have no idea where they want to
                go. This website is to get people exicted for the
                outdoors and enjoy what Utah has to offer. There
                are not a lot of websites that give you much camping
                sites or trails to go on, most don't even have tips
                or safety guides to help you learn how to be a proper
                camper. This is how it all started. Here at Camping Is
                Fun we have created and given the best information that
                any one can get out of a helpful and educational website.
