                    <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

                    I would say Amazon fits into a hick's law. Where
                    the user is given more options to chosen from
                    which makes the user take longer to decide on that
                    item. The more the user clicks on an item to view
                    the more options is given to the user through that
                    item. It will take the user a while to shop on
                    Amazon because they want to find the best
                    affordable product on Amazon. As more products are
                    being released, the more that Amazon will increase
                    there options.

                    <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
                <p>Redbox</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.redbox.com"></a>Redbox</p>

                <p>
                    I felt that Redbox fits into the fitt's law.
                    The way the it has it's target element closer
                    then streaming platforms. The shopping cart is
                    on the right and above that you have the sign in.
                    As well as the search bar, this is a good example
                    of what fitt's law would look like because I would
                    not have to spend time looking for the shopping
                    or sign in button, they are already there. Redbox
                    gives the user everything he would need to use in
                    there website, giving the user to use the website
                    as quickly as possible.

                    <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
                <p>Peony and Pine</p>

                    Peony and Pine fits into the rule of thirds.
                    The rule of thirds is have images or a video
                    used throughout the website in a unique way
                    without centering every image. Peony and pine
                    photography shows there photography in a
                    interesting way. One section of the homepage
                    you get a stack of photos that are together
                    and as you go through the webpage you get all
                    sorts of landscapes and wedding photos that
                    are sperade and it gives the user an idea of what
                    the company is all about without have to search
                    or find examples in the website. It is all
                    displayed on that webpage.
