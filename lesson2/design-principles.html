                    <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
                    <p class="p-1">Amazon</p>
                    <p class="link-1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a></p>

                        I would say Amazon fits into a hick's law. Where
                        the user is given more options to chosen from
                        which makes the user take longer to decide on that
                        item. The more the user clicks on an item to view
                        the more options is given to the user through that
                        item. It will take the user a while to shop on
                        Amazon because they want to find the best
                        affordable product on Amazon. As more products are
                        being released, the more that Amazon will increase
                        there options.

                    <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
                    <p class="p-2">Redbox</p>
                    <p class="link-2"><a href="https://www.redbox.com">Redbox</a></p>

                    <p>
                        I felt that Redbox fits into the fitt's law.
                        The way the it has it's target element closer
                        then streaming platforms. The shopping cart is
                        on the right and above that you have the sign in.
                        As well as the search bar, this is a good example
                        of what fitt's law would look like because I would
                        not have to spend time looking for the shopping
                        or sign in button, they are already there. Redbox
                        gives the user everything he would need to use in
                        there website, giving the user to use the website
                        as quickly as possible.

                    <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
                    <p class="p-3">Peony and Pine</p>
                    <p class="link-3"><a href="https://www.peonyandpine.com">Peony and Pine</a></p>

                    <p>
                        Peony and Pine fits into the rule of thirds.
                        The rule of thirds is have images or a video
                        used throughout the website in a unique way
                        without centering every image. Peony and pine
                        photography shows there photography in a
                        interesting way. One section of the homepage
                        you get a stack of photos that are together
                        and as you go through the webpage you get all
                        sorts of landscapes and wedding photos that
                        are sperade and it gives the user an idea of what
                        the company is all about without have to search
                        or find examples in the website. It is all
                        displayed on that webpage.
